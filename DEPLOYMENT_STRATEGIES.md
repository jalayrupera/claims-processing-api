### Recommendation for Claims Processing API

For the Claims Processing API, which handles healthcare data with regulatory requirements:

1. **Current Stage**: The current Loki implementation is appropriate for development and early production
2. **Growth Phase**: 
   - Retain Loki for operational logs
   - Add PostgreSQL logging for transactional/claim-related logs that require ACID properties
   - Set up log export to object storage (S3/GCS) for archival
3. **Enterprise Scale**:
   - Implement a multi-tier storage strategy with hot/warm/cold log storage
   - Consider compliance-specific storage for logs containing PHI or regulatory data
   - Add log analytics capabilities for business intelligence

### Justification

This recommendation balances:
- **Performance**: Fast access to operational logs with Loki
- **Compliance**: Proper storage for healthcare-related data
- **Cost-effectiveness**: Tiered storage to optimize costs
- **Scalability**: Solution that grows with the application
- **Operational efficiency**: Manageable by a small team

The structured JSON logging we've implemented makes this strategy viable, as logs can be easily routed to different storage systems based on their content and criticality.
